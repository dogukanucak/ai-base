# TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.

## Key Features

- Static typing
- Class-based object-oriented programming
- Type inference
- Generics
- Interfaces
- Modules
- ECMAScript compatibility

## Benefits

TypeScript offers several benefits over JavaScript:

1. Early error detection through static typing
2. Better IDE support with intelligent code completion
3. Easier refactoring
4. Enhanced code readability and maintainability
5. Support for latest JavaScript features
